*   The E-Mail Filter is used to identify the vendor on the LogicApp side.
*   When the File Filter is applied, only e-mails that contain an attachment with the filter text in the attachment name will be forwarded.
*   This is also the case for the extension of the attachment and the File Extension Filter field.
